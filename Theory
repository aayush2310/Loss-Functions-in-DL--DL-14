Loss function is a method of evaluating how well your algo is modelling your dataset.
measures the performance of algo
loss more->poor performance
mathematical function
function of ML parameters

hinge loss-in SVM

In keras we have a functionality using which we can make our own loss functions.
depending on the problem loss functions change

difference b/w loss and cost function:-
loss function is calculated over single training example.
cost function is calculated over the whole batch.
the activation function of the last node in an ANN must be linear for mse to be applicable to that ANN,in between layers(hidden layers),we can take any activation func.
if our data has 25percent outliers,then neither mse nor mae will perform best.
in huber loss,if our data point is not an outlier,then huber loss will behave like mse,if it is outlier then it will behave like mae.through delta we know whether the 
point is hyperparameter or not.-used when our data has lots of outlier.
bce-log loss
sparse categorical entropy is preffered over categorical cross entropy because it is fast and we do not need to do one hot encoding(coding in 0 and 1) in it.
if working with less number of categories use-cce
if working with high number of categories use-sce
